## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of

Make a circle in paper, divide it in 5 parts, write "start", "stop", "continue", "more of" nad "less of" on the divided parts.

Ask from the team members what works, what should be done more, what should be done less, what should we stop doing? etcetc...

Clarify what categories the comments belong to and write them down

Hang the poster on the office wall and point to it when needed.


## Glad, Sad, Mad

Team members make notes that explain some observation they have made, they then one at a time explain what each note means, and places them on a poster in either "glad", "sad" or "mad" category.

After this the observations that mean the same thing are grouped, and some are selected for further discussion.
